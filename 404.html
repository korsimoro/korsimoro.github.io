state of the digital identity ecosystem is too complex.  Korismoro brings visibility to this complexity through web accessible <a href="https://d3js.org/"><span class="css-ofkn9f">D3</span></a>portals and exportable<a href="https://gephi.org/"><span class="css-ofkn9f">Gephi</span></a> graphs powered by traditional API-backed NoSQL databases.  Using these tools we help answer questions about the state of the art in digital identity.</div><ul class="css-1jzh81"><li class="css-rljj8o"><span class="css-7jgeyq">Community Analysis</span><div class="css-y9pamy"><span>What are the personal and organizational relationships in the managed and self-sovereign identity envrionment? How are the participants of the<a href="http://identity.foundation"><span class="css-ofkn9f">Decentralized Identity Foundation</span></a>related to managed identity players in government and the private sector? Which governments are active in promoting self-sovereignty and decentralization and which governments favor centralized identity solutions?  How can an investor objectively assess the identity solution employed by each new ICO?</span></div></li><li class="css-rljj8o"><span class="css-7jgeyq">Accessibility Analysis</span><div class="css-y9pamy"><span>The issue of identity inclusion is receiving a great deal of support from organizations such as the United Nations.  Simultaneously, a large number of ICOs promise secure control over your digital life with an unwritten assumption that you are already a cryptocurrency enthusiast and a multi-year vetran of IPFS.  Efforts to secure the data flow between your IoT devices and trusted sources are not broadly relevant to humanity and cater primarily to the monied elite of heavily industrialized societies.  How can we objectively assess the landscape of identity solutions against the true planetary demographics?</span></div></li><li class="css-rljj8o"><span class="css-7jgeyq">Operations Analysis</span><div class="css-y9pamy"><span>The risks of centrally managed systems or systems controlled by a single organization are well understood.  Decentralized systems address those risks, but are subject to the same forces of consolidation, especially when it comes to operations.  How do we measure the operational diversity of decentralized systems and equitably compare them with the risks from centralized systems?  How can we objectively assess and visualize Diffuse Trust and System Diversity as described in the<a href="https://www.evernym.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SovrinProvisionalTrustFramework2017-03-22.pdf"><span class="css-ofkn9f">Sovrin Trust Framework</span></a>, and how can we assess these concepts in other identity systems. What dangers lurk in our reliance upon only a small number of smart phone vendors and carriers?  What transaction volumes are claimed by blockchain solutions and how do those claims match objective measurement and monitoring?</span></div></li><li class="css-rljj8o"><span class="css-7jgeyq">Legislative Analysis</span><div class="css-y9pamy"><span>World governments and regulatory institutions are currently struggling with contradictory efforts to both promote and compromise individual security.  Numerous organizations are engaged on both sides of this battle.  Who are they, how are they related, and what are the key elements of legislation in play?</span></div></li></ul><h4>Technical Pragmatics</h4><div class="css-y9pamy">The technology of digital identity remains difficult to access, even for the experienced developer.  Discussions and analysis in myriad working groups is mired in an endless need to introduce the details of Alice and Bob for their immediate purposes.  Both of these factors slow the development of a robust global identity ecosystem.</div><ul class="css-1jzh81"><li class="css-rljj8o"><span class="css-7jgeyq">Use Cases</span><div class="css-y9pamy"><span>The complexity of digital identity is as unique and varied as all of humanity and grows ever more complex when organizations, animals, and objects are included.  A lack of richly annotated reference cases hinders objective and comparative analysis of the capabilities and liabilities of managed and decentralized identity systems.  Alice and Bob simply do not capture the full range of identity configurations, requirements, and relationships and a larger, expanded, reference set is required.<br/>Furthermore, larger database of reference cases is required when assessing legal frameworks such as the <a href="https://www.evernym.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SovrinProvisionalTrustFramework2017-03-22.pdf"><span class="css-ofkn9f">Sovrin Trust Framework</span></a>, domain specific trust frameworks, and the explicit and implicit trust frameworks deployed by other systems, such as those effectively relying upon the KYC procedures of cryptocurrency exchanges.</span></div></li><li class="css-rljj8o"><span class="css-7jgeyq">Wide Adoption</span><div class="css-y9pamy"><span>Deploying testbeds for identity system development is complicated and is a barrier to the global adoption and deep integration required to reclaim the sovereignty of identity.  Tasks such as a functioning Hyperledger environment, spinning up a local, non testchain Bitcoin or uPort environment, or testing and developing a functioning <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/universal-resolver"><span class="css-ofkn9f">Universal DID Resolver</span></a> needs to be as simple as<span class="css-1le19lm">npm install sdk; npm run setup</span>.  By deploying such test systems ourselves, and executing scenarios using the test cases described above, we believe we can lower the barrier to truly wide and uniquitous adoption of the key technologies of decentralized identity.</span></div></li></ul><h4>Research and Miscellany</h4><ul class="css-1jzh81"><li class="css-rljj8o"><span class="css-7jgeyq">Managed/Sovereign Bridge</span><div class="css-y9pamy"><span>Managed identity systems, such as the IAM environments operated by governments and employers, are a vital and integral part of modern life.  Regulatory requirements are often at odds with the principles of self-sovereignty, resulting in pragmatically mandatory surrender of sovereignty.  While you may choose to participate in social networks or consumer loyalty programs, you may not choose to participate in governmental systems.  For pragmatic reasons it may not be possible to opt out of employer driven systems, resulting in loss of sovereignty in exchange for a paycheck.  Cryptographic and best practice solutions to these problems are well established, but bridging the gap is a more difficult battle.  Can we visualize the points at which governments, regulatory agencies, and employment practices introduce risk and threaten sovereignty.</span></div></li><li class="css-rljj8o"><span class="css-7jgeyq">Reclusivity Rights</span><div class="css-y9pamy"><span>Reculsivity is a fundamental human right, but is bounded by the social contract.  Is it possible to regain reclusivity while supporting the demands of a global society?  While GDPR is a first and enlightened step in the right direction, it is not yet a global solution.  In fact, it is actively and persistently challenged in autocratic environments and in societies hampered by intrasocial wars, such as the United State&#x27;s wars on terror and drugs. In terms of specific institutions and legal frameworks, is it even practical to regain lost reclusivity and if so, how?</span></div></li><li class="css-rljj8o"><span class="css-7jgeyq">iFreedom - Device Decoupling</span><div class="css-y9pamy"><span>Your identity is a matter of physics and it has no direct relationship to a handheld computer or other device.  Over-reliance upon smartphones, software, and hardware gadgetry such as cryptographic processors and embedded biometric sensors, is a serious and blossomming threat to the integrity of personal identity.  The physical management of a centrally manufactured and heavily monitored, fundamentally insecure, bricks of plastic and metal should never be the foundation upon which a digital identity is anchored. Device reliance has endangered the personal identity of billions through inappropriate cultivation of the myth of device integrity.  Many groups and organizations are actively engaged in responding to the threats imposed by governments which continually pressure device manufacturers to weaken privacy protection. The scope and details of this contest can be hard to grasp and will benefit from improved visualization of the key players and contests.</span></div></li><li class="css-rljj8o"><span class="css-7jgeyq">A Bit of Fun</span><div class="css-y9pamy"><span>Issues of individuality and identity are weighty, so watch for the Korsimoro logo in your environment and engage the <i>levity of identity</i>.  We have introduced a physical testbed of non-electronic identities and are in the process of deploying a card based PoC game.</span></div></li></ul><div class="css-1djokxb">Doors open 1/1/2019</div></div></section></div><script type="text/javascript">window.__CSS_CHUNKS__ = {}</script><script type="text/javascript">
